## Building create experiences

The Azure portal offers 3 ways to build a create form:

1. *[Deploy to Azure](portalfx-create-deploytoazure.md)*

    There are simple forms auto-generated from an ARM template with very basic controls and validation. Deploy to Azure is the quickest way to build a Create form and even integrate with the Marketplace, but is very limited in available validation and controls.

    Use [Deploy to Azure](portalfx-create-deploytoazure.md) for [community templates](https://azure.microsoft.com/documentation/templates) and simple forms.

2. *[Solution templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-marketplace/wiki)*

    These are simple forms defined by a JSON document separate from the template. Solution templates can be used by any service, however there are some limitations on supported controls.

    Use [Solution templates](https://github.com/Azure/azure-marketplace/wiki) for IaaS-focused ARM templates.

3. *Custom create forms*

    These are fully customized forms built using TypeScript in an Azure portal extension. Most teams build custom create forms for full flexibility in the UI and validation. This requires developing an extension.

## Building custom create forms

### Create Marketplace package (aka Gallery package) - Optional
The Marketplace provides a categorized collection of packages which can be created in the portal. Publishing your package to the Marketplace is simple:

1. Create a package and publish it to the DF Marketplace yourself, if applicable. Learn more about [publishing packages to the Marketplace](../../gallery-sdk/generated/index-gallery.md).
1. Side-load your extension to test it locally.
1. Set a "hide key" before testing in production.
1. Send the package to the Marketplace team to publish it for production.
1. Notify the Marketplace team when you're ready to go live.

Note that the **+New** menu is curated and can change at any time based on C+E leadership business goals. Ensure documentation, demos, and tests use [Create from Browse](portalfx-browse.md) or [deep-links](portalfx-links.md) as the entry point.

![The +New menu][plus-new]

![The Marketplace][marketplace]

If your create does not require a marketplace item, you can set your decorator to not require it when the blade is launched.

### Design for a single blade
All create experiences should be designed for a single blade. Start by building a NoPdl Create blade. Always prefer dropdowns over pickers (form fields that allow selecting items from a list in a child blade) and avoid using selectors (form fields that open child blades).

Email [ibizafxpm](mailto:ibizafxpm@microsoft.com?subject=Full-screen Create) if you have any questions about the current state of full-screen create experiences.

### Add a provisioning decorator
The [typescript decorator framework](portalfx-no-pdl.md) enables you to build UX to collect data from the user. If you're not familiar with decorator blades, now is a good time to read more about it.

In most cases, your blade will be launched from the Marketplace, a deep link, or a toolbar command (like Create from Browse), but you are able to open create blades directly with a blade reference.

### Add a provisioner decorator
A provisioning decorator is another component of template blades. 

```ts
import * as TemplateBlade from "Fx/Composition/TemplateBlade";
@TemplateBlade.DoesProvisioning.Decorator({ requiresMarketplaceId: true }) // requiresMarketplaceId defaults to true if you don't provide this options object
export class CreateArmEngineBlade {
    public context: TemplateBlade.DoesProvisioning.Context;
}
```

This decorator adds a provisioning property to the context of your blade which enables you to harness the framework's provisioning capabilities. There are 2 specific scenarios this covers.

1. ARM provisioning:
(Refer to the full CreateArmEngineBlade sample to see the full create blade)

```ts
context.provisioning.deployTemplate({
    subscriptionId: subscriptionId,
    resourceGroupName: resourceGroupName,
    resourceGroupLocation: resourceGroupLocation,
    parameters: {
        someProperty: data.someProperty()
    },
    deploymentName: galleryCreateOptions.deploymentName,
    resourceProviders: [resourceProvider],
    resourceId: resourceIdFormattedString,
    // For the deployment template, you can either pass a link to the template (the URI of the
    // template uploaded to the gallery service), or the actual JSON of the template (inline).
    // Since gallery package for this sample is on your local box (under Local Development),
    // we can't send ARM a link to template. We'll use inline JSON instead. This method returns
    // the exact same template as the one in the package. Once your gallery package is uploaded
    // to the gallery service, you can reference it as shown on the second line.
    templateJson: this._getTemplateJson(),
    // Or -> templateLinkUri: galleryCreateOptions.deploymentTemplateFileUris["TemplateName"],
});
```

2. Custom provisioning:
(Refer to the full CreateCustomRobotBlade sample to see the full create blade)
```ts
// Raise a notification, if needed.
// MsPortalFx.UI.NotificationManager.create(...).raise(...);
context.provisioning.deployCustom({
    provisioningPromise: Q(model.robotData.createRobot(newRobot)).then((data) => {
        // Close blade, notification will update when creation is complete
        container.closeCurrentBlade();
        // Adding some extra wait time to make the operation seem longer.
        return newRobot;
    }),
    supplyPartReference: (provisionedRobot) => {
        return new PartReference("RobotPart", { id: provisionedRobot.name() }, { extensionName: "SamplesExtension" });
    },
})
```

### Build your form
Use built-in form fields, like TextField and DropDown, to build your form the way you want. Use the built-in EditScope integration to manage changes and warn customers if they leave the form.

```ts
// The parameter provider takes care of instantiating and initializing an edit scope for you,
// so all we need to do is point our form's edit scope to the parameter provider's edit scope.
this.editScope = this.parameterProvider.editScope;
```
Learn more about [building forms](portalfx-forms.md).

### Standard ARM fields
All ARM subscription resources require a subscription, resource group, location and pricing dropdown. The portal offers built-in controls for each of these. Refer to the EngineV3 Create sample (`SamplesExtension\Extension\Client\Create\EngineV3\ViewModels\CreateEngineBladeViewModel.ts`) for a working example.
### Setting the value
Each of these fields will retrieve values from the server and populate a dropdown with them. If you wish to set the value of these dropdowns, make sure to lookup the value from the `fetchedValues` array, and then set the `value` observable.
```ts
locationDropDown.value(locationDropDown.fetchedValues().first((value)=> value.name === "centralus"))
```

### Resource dropdowns
#### Subscriptions dropdown
```ts
import * as SubscriptionDropDown from "Fx/Controls/SubscriptionDropDown";
```
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/VS/PT/Default/Extension/Client/Resource/Create/ViewModels/CreateBlade.ts", "section": "config#subscriptionDropDown"}

#### Resource groups dropdown
```ts
import * as ResourceGroupDropDown from "Fx/Controls/ResourceGroupDropDown";
```
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/VS/PT/Default/Extension/Client/Resource/Create/ViewModels/CreateBlade.ts", "section": "config#resourceGroupDropDown"}
#### Locations dropdown
```ts
import * as LocationDropDown from "Fx/Controls/LocationDropDown";
```
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../Samples/VS/PT/Default/Extension/Client/Resource/Create/ViewModels/CreateBlade.ts", "section": "config#locationDropDown"}

### ARM dropdown options
Each ARM dropdown can disable, hide, group, and sort.
 
#### Disable
This is the preferred method of disallowing the user to select a value from ARM. The disable callback will run for each fetched value from ARM. The return value of your callback will be a reason for why the value is disabled. If no reason is provided, then the value will not be disabled. This is to ensure the customer has information about why they canâ€™t select an option, and reduces support calls.
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/Framework.Tests/TypeScript/Tests/Controls/Forms/DropDown.Resource.test.ts", "section": "config#disable"}
When disabling, the values will be displayed in groups with the reason they are disabled as the group header. Disabled groups will be placed at the bottom of the dropdown list.
 
#### Hide
This is an alternative method of disallowing the user to select a value from ARM. The hide callback will run for each fetched value from ARM. The return value of your callback will return a boolean for if the value should be hidden. If you choose to hide, a message telling the user why some values are hidden is required.
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/Framework.Tests/TypeScript/Tests/Controls/Forms/DropDown.Resource.test.ts", "section": "config#hide"}

##### Note on Hide
It's recommended to use the `disable` option so you can provide scenario-specific detail as to why a given dropdown value is disabled, and customers will be able to see that their specific desired value is not available. Disabling is preferable to hiding, as users often react negatively when they cannot visually locate their expected dropdown value.  In extreme cases, this can trigger incidents with your Blade.

#### Group
This is a way for you to group values in the dropdown. The group callback will take a value from the dropdown and return a display string for which group the value should be in. If no display string or an empty string is provided, then the value will default to the top level of the group dropdown.
 
If you want to sort the groups (not the values within the group), you can supply the 'sort' option, which should be a conventional comparator function that determines the sort order by returning a number greater or less than zero. It defaults to alphabetical sorting.
 
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/Framework.Tests/TypeScript/Tests/Controls/Forms/DropDown.Resource.test.ts", "section": "config#group"}
 
If you both disable and group, values which are disabled will be placed under the disabled group rather than the grouping provided in this callback.
 
#### Sort
If you want to sort values in the dropdown, supply the 'sort' option, which should be a convention comparator function that returns a number greater or less than zero. It defaults to alphabetical based on the display string of the value.
 
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/Framework.Tests/TypeScript/Tests/Controls/Forms/DropDown.Resource.test.ts", "section": "config#sort"}
 
If you sort and use disable or group functionality, this will sort inside of the groups provided.

### Edit scope based accessible dropdowns
### Migrating from legacy ARM dropdowns to Accessible versions
For scenarios where your Form is built in the context of an EditScope, the FX now provides versions of the new, accessible ARM dropdowns that are drop-in replacements for old, non-accessible controls.  These have minimal API changes and are simple to integrate into existing Blades/Parts.

These dropdowns are, however, based on a new accessible control which no longer support the following options.

- `cssClass` - no alternative
- `dropDownWidth` - no alternative
- `filterOptions` - no alternative
- `hideValidationCheck` - no alternative
- `iconLookup` - no alternative
- `iconSize` - no alternative
- `infoBalloonContent` - no alternative
- `inputAlignment` - no alternative
- `labelPosition` - The `label` option accepts html
- `options` - no alternative
- `popupAlignment` - no alternative
- `showValidationMessagesBelowControl` - no alternative
- `subLabel` - The `label` option accepts html
- `subLabelPosition` - The `label` option accepts html
- `telemetryKeys` - no alternative
- `viewModelValueChangesAreClean` - no alternative
- `visible` - use the `visible` binding in your html template

#### Subscriptions dropdown
In your current EditScope-based form, your Subscription dropdown looks something like this:
```ts
import SubscriptionsDropDown = MsPortalFx.Azure.Subscriptions.DropDown;
// The subscriptions drop down.
var subscriptionsDropDownOptions: SubscriptionsDropDown.Options = {
    options: ko.observableArray([]),
    form: this,
    accessor: this.createEditScopeAccessor((data) => {
        return data.subscription;
    }),
    validations: ko.observableArray<MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Validation>([
        new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.selectSubscription)
    ]),
    // Providing a list of resource providers (NOT the resource types) makes sure that when
    // the deployment starts, the selected subscription has the necessary permissions to
    // register with the resource providers (if not already registered).
    // Example: Providers.Test, Microsoft.Compute, etc.
    resourceProviders: ko.observable([resourceProvider]),
    // Optional -> You can pass the gallery item to the subscriptions drop down, and the
    // the subscriptions will be filtered to the ones that can be used to create this
    // gallery item.
    filterByGalleryItem: this._galleryItem
};
this.subscriptionsDropDown = new SubscriptionsDropDown(container, subscriptionsDropDownOptions);
```

With the new, accessible Subscription dropdown, you'll change your code to look something like:
```ts
import * as SubscriptionDropDown from "FxObsolete/Controls/SubscriptionDropDown";
```
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/AcceptanceTests/Extensions/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Create/EngineV3/ViewModels/CreateEngineBladeViewModel.ts", "section": "config#subscriptionDropDown"}

#### Resource groups **legacy** dropdown
In your current EditScope-based form, your Resource Group dropdown looks something like this:
```ts
import ResourceGroupsDropDown = MsPortalFx.Azure.ResourceGroups.DropDown;
// The resource group drop down.
var resourceGroupsDropDownOptions: ResourceGroups.DropDown.Options = {
    options: ko.observableArray([]),
    form: this,
    accessor: this.createEditScopeAccessor((data) => {
        return data.resourceGroup;
    }),
    label: ko.observable<string>(ClientResources.resourceGroup),
    subscriptionIdObservable: this.subscriptionsDropDown.subscriptionId,
    validations: ko.observableArray<MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Validation>([
        new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.selectResourceGroup),
        new MsPortalFx.Azure.RequiredPermissionsValidator(requiredPermissionsCallback)
    ]),
    // This is no longer supported. Set the `value` option to initial desired value
    defaultNewValue: "NewResourceGroup",
    // Optional -> RBAC permission checks on the resource group. Here, we're making sure the
    // user can create an engine under the selected resource group, but you can add any actions
    // necessary to have permissions for on the resource group.
    requiredPermissions: ko.observable({
        actions: actions,
        // Optional -> You can supply a custom error message. The message will be formatted
        // with the list of actions (so you can have {0} in your message and it will be replaced
        // with the array of actions).
        message: ClientResources.enginePermissionCheckCustomValidationMessage.format(actions.toString())
    })
};
this.resourceGroupDropDown = new ResourceGroups.DropDown(container, resourceGroupsDropDownOptions);
```

With the new, accessible Resource Group dropdown, you'll change your code to look something like:
```ts
import * as ResourceGroupDropDown from "FxObsolete/Controls/ResourceGroupDropDown";
```
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/AcceptanceTests/Extensions/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Create/EngineV3/ViewModels/CreateEngineBladeViewModel.ts", "section": "config#resourceGroupDropDown"}

#### Locations **legacy** dropdown
In your current EditScope-based form, your Location dropdown looks something like this:
```ts
import LocationsDropDown = MsPortalFx.Azure.Locations.DropDown;
// The locations drop down.
var locationsDropDownOptions: LocationsDropDown.Options = {
    options: ko.observableArray([]),
    form: this,
    accessor: this.createEditScopeAccessor((data) => {
        return data.location;
    }),
    subscriptionIdObservable: this.LocationDropDown.subscriptionId,
    resourceTypesObservable: ko.observable([resourceType]),
    validations: ko.observableArray<MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Validation>([
        new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.selectLocation)
    ])
    // Optional -> This is no longer supported. Use the `disable` option (illustrated below).
    // filter: {
    //     allowedLocations: {
    //         locationNames: [ "centralus" ],
    //         disabledMessage: "This location is disabled for demo purposes (not in allowed locations)."
    //     },
    //     OR -> disallowedLocations: [{
    //         name: "westeurope",
    //         disabledMessage: "This location is disabled for demo purposes (disallowed location)."
    //     }]
    // }
};
```

With the new, accessible Location dropdown, you'll change your code to look something like:
```ts
import * as LocationDropDown from "FxObsolete/Controls/LocationDropDown";
```
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/AcceptanceTests/Extensions/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Create/EngineV3/ViewModels/CreateEngineBladeViewModel.ts", "section": "config#locationDropDown"}

#### Pricing dropdown
```ts
*`MsPortalFx.Azure.Pricing.DropDown`

import * as Specs from "Fx/Specs/DropDown";
```
{"gitdown": "include-section", "file": "../../../src/SDK/AcceptanceTests/Extensions/SamplesExtension/Extension/Client/V1/Create/EngineV3/ViewModels/CreateEngineBladeViewModel.ts", "section": "config#specDropDown"}

#### Additional/custom validation to the ARM fields
Sometimes you need to add extra validation on any of the previous ARM fields. For instance, you might want to check with you RP/backend to make sure that the selected location is available in certain circumstances. To do that, just add a custom validator like you would do with any regular form field. Example:

```ts
// The locations drop down.
var locationCustomValidation = new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.CustomValidation(
    validationMessage,
    (value) => {
        return this._dataContext.validateLocation(value).then((isValid) => {
            // Resolve with undefined if 'value' is a valid selection and with an error message otherwise.
            return MsPortalFx.ViewModels.getValidationResult(!isValid && validationMessage || undefined);
        }, (error) => {
            // Make sure your custom validation never throws. Catch the error, log the unexpected failure
            // so you can investigate later, and fail open.
            logError(...);
            return MsPortalFx.ViewModels.getValidationResult();
        });
    });
var locationsDropDownOptions: LocationsDropDown.Options = {
    ...,
    validations: ko.observableArray<MsPortalFx.ViewModels.Validation>([
        new MsPortalFx.ViewModels.RequiredValidation(ClientResources.selectLocation),
        locationCustomValidation // Add your custom validation here.
    ])
    ...
};
this.locationsDropDown = new LocationsDropDown(container, locationsDropDownOptions);
```

#### PDL Wizards and Creates
The Azure portal has a **legacy pattern** for wizard blades, however customer feedback and usability has proven the design
isn't ideal and shouldn't be used. Additionally, earlier creates weren't designed for [No pdl decorators](portalfx-no-pdl.md).
and leads to a more complicated design and extended development time. The Portal team recommends a new pattern with full screen
create blades utilizing the tabs controls as seen in the [No Pdl Engine Blade](engine-blade)

Email [ibizafxpm](mailto:ibizafxpm@microsoft.com?subject=Create wizards + full screen) if you have any questions about
the current state of wizards and full-screen Create support.

### Validation
Create is our first chance to engage with and win customers and every hiccup puts us at risk of losing customers; specifically
new customers. As a business, we need to lead that engagement on a positive note by creating resources quickly and easily.
When a customer clicks the Create button, it should succeed. This includes all types of errors â€“ from
using the wrong location to exceeding quotas  to unhandled exceptions in the backend. [Adding validation to your form fields](portalfx-forms-field-validation.md)
will help avoid failures and surface errors before deployment.

In an effort to resolve Create success regressions as early as possible, sev 2 [ICM](http://icm.ad.msft.net) (internal only)
incidents will be created and assigned to extension teams whenever the success rate
drops 5% or more for 50+ deployments over a rolling 24-hour period.


### Automation options
The provisioning decorator provides an "Automation options" blade reference in the provisioning context.
This can be invoked in the same way as a template deployment. You can add this next to your create button.
```
container.openBlade(provisioning.getAutomationBladeReference(this._supplyTemplateDeploymentOptions())
```

### Testing
Due to the importance of Create and how critical validation is, all Create forms should have automated testing to help
avoid regressions and ensure the highest possible quality for your customers. Refer to [testing guidance](portalfx-test.md)
for more information on building tests for your form.

### Feedback

When customers leave the Create blade before submitting the form, the portal asks for feedback. The feedback is stored
in the standard [telemetry](portalfx-telemetry.md) tables. Query for
`source == "FeedbackPane" and action == "CreateFeedback"` to get Create abandonment feedback.


### Telemetry

We've added a `ProvisioningBladeOpen` telemetry event to create which records duration telemetry as well as success and abandoned
states based on whether the user completed a create or closed out before provisioning. For example you can see [how long](create-length-telemetry)
it takes for your customers to decide whether or not to create your resource. Just set `extensionName` in the query to see your blade.


For deployment telemetry, refer to [Create telemetry](/portal-sdk/generated/index-portalfx-extension-monitor.md#portalfx-telemetry-create) for additional information on usage dashboards and queries.

### Troubleshooting

Refer to the [troubleshooting guide](portalfx-create-troubleshooting.md) for additional debugging information.


### Additional topics

#### Initiating Create from other places
Some scenarios may require launching your Create experience from outside the +New menu or Marketplace. The following
are supported patterns:

* **From a command using the ParameterCollectorCommand** -- "Add Web Tests" command from the "Web Tests" blade for a web app
* **From a part using the SetupPart flow** -- "Continuous Deployment" setup from a web app blade
